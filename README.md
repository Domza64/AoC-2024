# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to 2024 Advent of Code!

## Language
I decided to learn basics of and practice python, so I will be solving this year's challenges in the snake language.

## AI
Regarding AI; despite using it almost daily I will not be using it for this and will revert to good'ol Stack overflow and searching the internet...

I broke my promise today, did day 16 part 1 with lots of help from ChatGPT :(, due to lack of time and motivation I think this will be it for me for this year...
